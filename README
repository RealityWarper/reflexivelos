Build instructions for maze and los2 on Linux/Mac OS X:

You have ncurses, right? Right.

g++ -o los2 los2.cpp -lncurses
g++ -o maze maze.cpp -lncurses

On Windows:

I know nothing about cursed libraries written for Windows, other than their existance and the fact that they differ from those on Linux. However, I have seen it compiled using Cygwin...

Usage:

los2 is plug and play. It's just a line of sight demo, after all... maze, on the other hand, expects an input file containing a valid description of a grid-manifold. If no file is given, it looks for a file called "maze.txt" in the current directory.

If you want to try out the random manifolds, use "maze -r". Follow that up with how big you want the manifold to be (default is 1000 locations). "maze -r 40" tends to produce very interesting results, as well.
